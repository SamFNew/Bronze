# Bronze
A (still in dev) that fits your server needs!
## What is Bronze?
Bronze is an open source semi-modular Discord.js bot.
## Can I use Bronze for my server?
Yes you can! You can invite Bronze using this link here, (Bot still in dev.)
You can also host it yourself, (Instructions coming soon.)
## Why is there a public and a private repository?
As Bronze is still in development, it's useful to have a full history of its development. So we have a private version where we can iron out the bug, then push to the public.
